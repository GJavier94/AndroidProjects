### [Dependency injection with Dagger ](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/dagger-basics)

- Manual dependency injection in an Android app can be problematic depending on the size of your project. 
- We can limit project's complexity as it scales up by using Dagger to manage dependencies.

Dagger automatically generates code that mimics the code would have been hand-written. 
Because the code is generated at compile time, it's traceable and more performant than other reflection-based solutions.

### MVVM Architecture

__MVVM__ is an architectural pattern in computer software that facilitates the separation of the development of the graphical user interface (GUI; the view)—be it via a markup language or GUI code—from the development of the business logic or back-end logic (the model) such that the view is not dependent upon any specific model platform.
