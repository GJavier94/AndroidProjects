### Dependency injection with Dagger 

- Manual dependency injection in an Android app can be problematic depending on the size of your project. 
- We can limit project's complexity as it scales up by using Dagger to manage dependencies.

Dagger automatically generates code that mimics the code would have been hand-written. 
Because the code is generated at compile time, it's traceable and more performant than other reflection-based solutions.

### MVVM Architecture
